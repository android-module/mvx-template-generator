#  multiple gradle daemons问题

1. 
```text
Multiple Gradle daemons might be spawned because the Gradle JDK and JAVA_HOME locations are different. 
Project 'android-hooker' is using the following JDK location when running Gradle: 
'/Applications/Android Studio Preview.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home' 
The system environment variable JAVA_HOME is: '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.15.1.jdk/Contents/Home' 
If you dont need to use different paths (or if JAVA_HOME is undefined), 
youcan avoid spawning multiple daemons by setting JAVA_HOME and the JDK locationto the same path.
```
2.
```text
Project Logger is using the following JDK location when running Gradle:
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home
Using different JDK locations on different processes might cause Gradle to
spawn multiple daemons, for example, by executing Gradle tasks from a terminal
while using Android Studio.

```

1. 原因是jdk版本不一致(自动一会在idea, 一会在android studio编译, 导致jdk版本没对上)
